# Pfam datasets 

This folder contains the five *pfam* datasets analyzed in Horta, Barrat-Charlaix and Weigt ([paper link](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/11/1090)). The five datasets are:
1. PF00111 
2. PF00013
3. PF00014
4. PF00046
5. PF00084

Each subfolder contains the following files associated with the family:
- Timed Phylogeny (`.nhx` suffix), generated by running FastTree ([link](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/)) on the seed alignment
- Full Alignment (`_full.txt` suffix), generated by `pfam` database
- Seed Alignment (`_seed.txt` suffix), generated by `pfam` database
- Seed Alignment Contact map (`_seed.DI` suffix), a three-column dataset generated by running DCA ([link](http://dca.rice.edu/portal/dca/home)) on the seed alignment 
- Seed Alignment Contact map visualization (`_seed.png` suffix), a heat map automatically generated by DCA 
- Full Alignment Contact map (`_full.DI` suffix), a three-column dataset generated by running DCA on the full alignment **missing**  
- Full Alignment Contact map visualization (`_full.png` suffix) **missing**  

## Remarks
1. DCA could not generate a contact map for PF00014 on either alignment. 
2. The online DCA workbench does not generate contact maps for full alignments. I can't get the DCA software (MATLAB-based) to work on my local CPU. Would appreciate some assistance here!  
2. Neil mentioned that their choice of alignment for their paper follows the procedure taken by the recent method trRosetta ([link](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1496)) by Yang et al. (2020), which is to use HHBlits-based alignments ([HHBlits link](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/clustalo)). I have to look at the *PNAS* paper's methods in greater detail, since it's not straightforward.
